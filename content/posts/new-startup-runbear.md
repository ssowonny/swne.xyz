I co-founded the new startup Runbear with Liam. Liam and I have worked together for 13 years. We founded two startups which were acquired by Kakao and Buzzvil, respectively.

Runbear is the third startup we have founded. Its mission is to help people stay simple and be more productive. For more information, check out [runbear.io](https://runbear.io).
